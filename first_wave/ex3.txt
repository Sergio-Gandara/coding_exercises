# Exercise number 3
# 
# In this exercise you have to make the same as in the previous exercise
# But eliminate the special disctinction in indexes of matrixes and just
# print in all spaces a ' ' character.
# You will have to make a '*' character at 1, 1.
# Screen must flush and take input from A-S-W-D keys to indicate direction.
# The asterisk must move accordingly to this input one space at a time, one # per associated input.
# CHALLENGE ONE: Make a random generation of '#' characters, if the asterisk# touches a hash character, it 
# will trigger a fully fledged Rock, Paper, 
# Scissors against a random-biased opponent. At the best of three, if the 
# player loses, the game exits. The player wins if three RSP battles are won
#
# CHALLENGE TWO: Make all the prior using functions and classes
# The asterisk may be a 'player' entity, whereas '#' may be a foe.
